## ***THIS IS THE NET 8 VERSION OF THE ORIGINAL TEMPLATE REPOSITORY***

- This template was created by SamJesus8, who has a Tutorial on how to make a 100% functioning Discord Bot
in C#, with many of the different features it can offer. Please watch this tutorial to understand more about what you can do.
